<h1>Aurora - 40 Channel Heliostat</h1>
<span class="image left"><a href="img/2019-Aurora/cover.jpg"><img src="img/2019-Aurora/cover.jpg" alt="Aurora Heliostat" /></a></span>
Aurora is an array of 40 mirrors, each able to tilt in two axes, to track the sun movement and enable artistic lighting based on sunlight.

Skills: Python, Mechanical Construction, Project Coordination

<h2>CCCamp19: Prototype</h2>
A first complete prototype was build on-site during the Chaos Communication Camp 2019
Together with project initiator blausand and a handful of on-site volunteers, we went from a single-channel prototype to a full 40 mirror array in roughly two weeks. We ordered 100 servo motors from China, and while waiting for their arrival, constructed the aluminium extrusion frame, mass-producted a suitable motor integration, and cut mirrors, often in collaboration with local enterprises. My role was prototype design, project coordination, electronic implementation and subsequently programming the motor control framework.

<h2>Vision<h2>
The name and shape of the project stems from the Aurora grain mill, situated on the Köln Poll harbour front. Our vision is to create a larger version (ø 8-10 m) and hang it on the former mill's building, replacing the original logo with a heliostat that would be able to bring light to the other bank of river Rhine, known for their "crane builidings" that, being on the west bank, do not get to enjoy sunlight until sunset.
